## Hi, I’m Aman Jha 👋

I’m a **Computer Science undergraduate** focused on building **production-grade software** at the intersection of  
**AI/ML, full-stack engineering, and system design**.

I care about **clean architecture, real-world impact, and learning things deeply instead of superficially**.

---

### 🧠 What I Work On
- **AI / Machine Learning**: Classical ML, model evaluation, data pipelines, ML-powered applications  
- **Full-Stack Development**: MERN stack, TypeScript, Next.js, REST APIs  
- **Backend & Systems**: Node.js, Prisma, SQL/NoSQL databases, authentication, API design  
- **Dev & Infra (learning + applying)**: Docker, monitoring, deployment, scalability concepts  
- **Problem Solving**: DSA in Java, algorithmic thinking, performance trade-offs

---

### 🚀 Current Focus
- Building **AI-integrated web products** (not just notebooks)
- Strengthening **DSA + system fundamentals** for high-impact roles
- Writing code that is **readable, testable, and deployable**

---

### 🛠 Tech Stack
**Languages:** Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python  
**Frontend:** React, Next.js, HTML, CSS  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, Prisma  
**Databases:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL  
**ML Tools:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy  
**Tools:** Git, Docker, Linux, IntelliJ, VS Code

---

### 📌 What You’ll Find Here
- End-to-end **projects with real use-cases**
- Clean implementations of **ML models**
- Backend systems with **auth, validation, and persistence**
- Experiments where I push beyond tutorials

---

### 🌱 Philosophy
I don’t chase buzzwords.  
I optimize for **fundamentals, leverage, and long-term skill compounding**.
